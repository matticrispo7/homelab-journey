# Homelab

Hi there.
After spending countless hours digging in the rabbit hole of subreddits like *r/selfhosted* and *r/homelab* (just to name two of them), several months ago i've decided to take this journey into homelabbing and right now i'm documenting it.
I've just started to study and this means I will surely do some dumb mistakes, so any advice from anyone with a higher expertise than mine is highly appreciated or even just get in touch to share some ideas.

In this repo you'll find all my notes, scripts, services and network architecture of my homelab.

## Equipment
After my bachelor degree I've decided to buy a Raspberry Pi4 with so many projects in mind.

   I've never realized one of them.

So, what better opportunity to give the Raspberry a second chance?
Right now my setup is composed by the Raspberry Pi4 with 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD used as boot and a L2 unmanaged switch.

I've got also 2 HDD of 1TB each and I'm thinking to build a NAS with them.

#### Further upgrades
I'm already looking to upgrade my setup with both a tiny pc (but I can't decide which one to take cause there are many options, spanning from Lenovo m910q, HP EliteDesk 800G3 and so on) and a L3 switch to create VLANs inside my home network.
